Note:  Currently, the following CFG files must exist in the CFG directory.
       All others will be created.

Test1_multi-bmi.cfg  (this is original "cfg_file" passed to initialize())
Test1_path_info.cfg
Test1_time_info.cfg

Also, the following directories should already exist:

__met, __misc, __soil, __topo, Test1_cfg
