==================================================
Steps to install TopoFlow in a conda environment
==================================================

1. Create and activate a conda environment:
   % conda create -n tf36
   % conda activate tf36
   This environment must stay activated for all remaining steps.

Note: To install in a Docker image, you may need to specify a
      particular Python version with a command like:
      % conda create -n tf36 python=3.9

2. Check which python version got installed:
   % python  (will show version at start)

3. Install required packages in tf36 environment:
   % conda install gdal
   % conda install matplotlib
   % conda install scipy
   % conda install imageio
   % conda install -c conda-forge imageio-ffmpeg
   % conda install -c conda-forge cfunits
   % conda install -c conda-forge netcdf4

Note: Installing gdal will install system-level binary files.

4. (Optional) Install 2 more packages.
   % conda install -c conda-forge nb_conda
   % conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab

Note: These are helpful for running TopoFlow in a Jupyter notebook
      but are not needed otherwise.

Note: On a Mac, the package jupyterlab will install Mac-specific dependencies
      such as "pyobjc-core" and "pyobjc-framework-Cocoa", which are not
      supported in a Linux (e.g. Docker) environment.  But nb_conda and
      jupyterlab are likely not needed in such an environment.

Note: numpy and many other packages get installed as dependencies
      of the above packages.

Note: pip was also installed in this environment:
   % which pip
     /Applications/anaconda3/envs/tf36/bin/pip

5. Download the TopoFlow Python Package from:
   github.com/peckhams/topoflow36
   
6. Install the TopoFlow Python package.
   Let TF36_DIR be the directory where the package was installed
   % pip install -e TF36_DIR

7. (Optional) Create a requirements.txt file (for pip) for this conda environment:
   % pip list --format=freeze > requirements.txt
